I did my first hour calculation with my Matthijs today and it was an interesting experience because he calculates a lot more hours for things than I had initially thought.
He gave me an idea. I actually am going to try to always double the amount of hours I estimate. So if I have eight hours for a task, I will do it in 16 I will say it will take 16 hours.
My goal is to work four hours a day, so if I have a full day task, if I can do it in 4 focused Pomodoros then everybody wins.

The rest of the day I just need to be available on teams. 

If I have many meetings these should be included in the 4 hours.
