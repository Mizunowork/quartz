This is the first time I'm actually using the thinkpad. And I think I want to use it much more. 

The macbook is awesome, but it is annoying having to detach it all the time. I could have the thinkpad + ipad in the living room, and just try to keep the mac in the office. 

The keyboard is actually quite nice, and now I'm just typing text and I don't have to switch between editing modes that much, it is actually quite comfortable to work on in vim.

Now typing this in neovim on ubuntu. It's quite nice, but pressing escape is definitely a bit of a hassle.
