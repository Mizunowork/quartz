I think 'The Bear' premieres today, so probably more lazy of a day. Okay, no I
misread things. I guess it's tomorrow?


## Notes {#notes}


### Thoughts {#thoughts}

-   I went down an mpv rabbithole. Thanks random person in one of my chats. I
    didn't realize [GitHub - bloc97/Anime4K: A High-Quality Real Time Upscaler for
    Anime Video](https://github.com/bloc97/Anime4K) was a thing. I think I notice the difference? I'm not on a 4K
    monitor, though.
    -   I'm finally watching [Steins;Gate]({{< relref "../../../main/steins_gate.md" >}}) - I've played the VN twice, but kept
        putting off watching the anime.
-   After finishing Chinese practice I think I want to work on my anki script
    using batch OpenAI calls?
-   Things I asked GPT today!
    -   "how do" with database migration tools (I'm building some side apps for
        funsies and I've used them before but never really knew "first principles"
        for them)
-   Sitting here pondering if I should change the name of this bullet point
    -   Thots
