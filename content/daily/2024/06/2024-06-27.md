### Thoughts / TIL {#thoughts-til}

-   Spent time futzing with [Eww - Widgets for everyone! - eww documentation](https://elkowar.github.io/eww/)
    -   I guess it's worth making a page for it? [eww]({{< relref "../../../main/eww.md" >}})
-   Still pondering some quartz changes I'd like to make, ox-hugo can use
    categories (e.g. @foo), hugo accommodates it - I'd like to see this reflected in
    quartz too but I'm not sure how I should handle them.
-   Spent awhile tinkering with warp - I still think the idea of a terminal you
    have to login to is really dumb, but aesthetically it's nice. I just wish you
    could get rid of the tabs. Seems like people have been requesting it since 2022
    so I doubt they're going to implement it anytime soon. It effectively makes it
    a non-starter as my meta+enter shortcut for terminal though.
-   I noticed quartz doesn't use my explorer changes when in a folder.
    Investigate + maybe make an issue(?)


## Journal {#journal}

Got behind on Chinese, caught up. The Bear S3 premiered today. Spent some timer
tinkering with eww but sticking with i3blocks for the moment. Future project.
