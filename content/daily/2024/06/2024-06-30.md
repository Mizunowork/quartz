## Agenda {#agenda}


### Tasks {#tasks}

-   [X] Chinese
    -   Didn't fully finish review. Blah.
-   [X] Read
    -   I fee like all the mpv documentation counts for this today
-   [X] Learn something new
    -   lots of things about mpv, filters, shaders, etc.


## Notes {#notes}

-   :TIL:  the scripts folder inside mpv, you can use lua scripts that run whenever
    you run mpv.
-   I'd like to add something to emacs/quartz that graphically links all my TILs,
    it'd be a neat thing to comb over.
-   Finished 'the bear' s3 - good, I liked the sole character episodes
-   had an idea of keeping things in mononotes, maybe refactor them if they get
    too big?


## Journal {#journal}

[mpv]({{< relref "../../../main/mpv.md" >}}) rabbithole! focusing on adding anime profile and getting around to adding vapoursynth
