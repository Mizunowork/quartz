# Turns out EU countries test for heavy metals on chocolate

All chocolate that is sold on the market in European countries is required by the European consumer law to test for heavy metals (otherwise it is illegal to sell it here). So all chocolate that you can buy in Europe has below 0.600 in Lead Cadmium and other metals.

80% of our Lead Cadmium intake comes from grains, vegetables, fruit, potatoes, milk, tea and juices.
