## Housekeeping
I've now been maintaining this garden for a year! My productivity on  it has not been what I've wanted it to be, but I can confidently say that working on this website does indeed help me with what I've outlined in [[Essays/why-i-garden|Why I Garden]].
## Pages
- New: [[Projects/latex|A Working Latex Install that Doesn't Suck]]
- Content update: [[Essays/no-ai-fraud-act|No AI FRAUD Act]]. I'm considering breaking the essay into atomic pieces in the Resources folder so that it's more of a helpful reference than a comprehensive argumentative piece. Even though `Dict/` is normally where I put atomic files, that directory is for epistemologically neutral information which this essay is not.
- Content update: [[Essays/on-linux|The Linux Experience]]
- Content update: [[Projects/my-computer|My Computer]]
- Okay, for real this time, only two sections left on ai-infringement.
## Status Updates
- Toyed with the light mode color scheme to make it a bit more consistently readable across brightnesses.
- Updated the index again.
