In various podcasts I've heard [[Matthew Walker]] give the same advice. He recommends getting out of bed after 30 minutes.

This applies to when trying to fall asleep or when you wake up in the middle of the night and are able to fall asleep again.

In these situations you should get out of bed and move to a different room and do something else. Avoid light or eating food and do something that is not very stimulating, such as reading a book or listening to a podcast.

I like to meditate in these situations.

The reasoning behind this is that the brain needs to be trained to exclusively associate the bed with sleep. The bed should not be associated with activities or being awake anymore, and this requires training and becoming intentional about sleep.
