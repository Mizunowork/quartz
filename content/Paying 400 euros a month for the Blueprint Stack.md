Today the blueprint stack released and I had been thinking about it for a few days, and after an hour of doubting in attending the group call that Brian Johnson was doing I decided to go for it and I purchased the stack. 
 
It is going to be €400 a month so €100 a week and it will cover all if not most of my supplementation needs. I’m currently not doing any supplementation and I’m feeling fine, but I want to give my body everything it needs to age well or to slow aging.
 
I was thinking a lot about the financial implications of committing slow to €400 a month and how it would impact my monthly savings, but actually it is much more important to have a well-designed supplement stack that I don’t have to think about.

Even just ordering and managing like 50 different pills would take at least an hour a week and if I set my hourly rate at €100 an hour, then I am basically already regaining that. 

That doesn't even include all of the research I would need to do to figure out the following:

- which supplements I need
- if they are organic
- if they are tested properly
- if they contain clinically relevant doses
- how much I should take a day

I'm paying Bryan Johnson to do that for me.
