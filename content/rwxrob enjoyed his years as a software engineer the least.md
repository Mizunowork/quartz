- software engineering teams are cutthroat
- how many lines of code did you write?
- Deadline coming up, why aren't you done yet?
- Every day was an emergency

Of course this is very dependent on the place where you work. But it's an interesting thing to reflect upon.

Also, make a distinction between a programmer and a software engineer. Programmers just follow the orders and create the code.

Something that I would probably enjoy doing, but this is likely to be replaced by AI.
