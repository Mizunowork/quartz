# Having good language input makes one more articulate

#publish 

I'm consuming content about learning how to speak better, and I realize I miss
having sophisticated language input. Technical writing is always technical and mechanic, as it should be. But it is rare to hear someone speak eloquently and articulate about Kubernetes. 

I am used to handling very complex writing and speech from I studied English at University or when studying Buddhist texts as a monk. And I miss it.

I came to this thought after listening to a podcast with Jordan Peterson. Hearing him speak so eloquently, articulate and precise is inspiring. I wonder how I can
involve that into my tech content.
