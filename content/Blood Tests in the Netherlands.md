This blood test provider seems to get the most attention in our WhatsApp group. They enable you to upload the metrics to InsideTracker:

However, the test does not include uploading to InsideTracker. You need to pay a separate subscription fee for that, but the test comes with a discount. The price for uploading to InsideTracker is â‚¬84.36 after the discount.
