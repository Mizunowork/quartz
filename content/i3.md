Started using my Ubuntu Thinkpad with i3. Had it on Gnome for a while, but I'm completely dependent on the ability to switch worskspaces using alt or cmd + 1-9.

I had a problem with Edge not loading my passwords for some reason, but when I randomly tried again this morning it worked ðŸ¤·

It brings me back to my days with AwesomeWM on Arch Linux, but I'm quite surprised with how well i3 works without any extra configuration. There is very little I want to change about it at this moment.
