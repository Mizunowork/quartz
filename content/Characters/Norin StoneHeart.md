## Tenets of the Watchers
A paladin who assumes the Oath of the Watchers
swears to safeguard mortal realms from other-
worldly threats.
- __Vigilance__ The threats you face are cunning,
powerful, and subversive. Be ever alert for their
corruption.
- __Loyalty__ Never accept gifts or favors from fiends or
those who truck with them. Stay true to your order,
your comrades, and your duty.
- __Discipline__ You are the shield against the endless
terrors that lie beyond the stars. Your blade must be
forever sharp and your mind keen to survive what
lies beyond.
