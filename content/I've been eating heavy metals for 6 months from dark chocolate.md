For over 6 months I've been eating at least 30 grams of Albert Heijn's Alter Eco 90% Peru dark chocolate a day, sometimes 60g or more.

Thinking I was doing the right thing by buying an organic and fairtrade product, it turns out that does not mean that it is well tested. Although these articles don't mention this exact type, since they come from the same producer I think I might have been consuming these heavy metals daily.

This gives me even more reason to trust [[Bryan Johnson]] and his Blueprint stack.

I will happily pay knowing that these ingredients are actually tested for heavy metals and properly sourced.
