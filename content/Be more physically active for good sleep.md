In this video Sadhguru talks about how people live at his ashram and how they work all the time and then feel ready for sleep in the evening. He talks about seeing people hard at work on the street and then they take a nap on the truck and they fall asleep instantly. Why is that? Because they are very active and are grateful to have a bit of rest.
