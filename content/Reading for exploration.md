Ali Abdaal has this notion of reading for exploration. You listen to audiobooks on double speed and you don't necessarily want to absorb all of the information with full focus. You are letting it stream by as you are driving or doing chores, and the interesting bits will stick out.

And then if you feel the book is worth it, you should sit down and read it properly and take notes.

Very interesting take.

Most books are mostly fluff anyway, I know from experience.
