I used to lie in bed and read for a long time and wait until I became sleepy. But from different sources, such as [[Bryan Johnson]], I'm deducing that you should use your bed only for sleep. 

I should train my brain to associate my bed only with sleeping. I'm therefore going to set up a reading corner in my living room with a chair, where I can read in the evening after my skin and oral hygiene routines. When I start to feel sleepy I can walk to my bed and very intentionally lie down and fall asleep quickly. 

This has to be come a habit. I should not lie in my bed and do other activities anymore. My brain should learn that the bed is exclusively for sleeping and sleeping only.

[[Get up after 30 minutes of trying to fall asleep or being awake]]
