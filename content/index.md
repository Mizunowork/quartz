I haven't prettied it up yet, but plan on using this as a dumping ground for notes and media and such.
The ideal would be then to utilize those for bigger articles on the [main site(?)](https://justin.vc) - we'll see how it goes. It's abit heavier on dependencies than I would like.

Before this I was planning on doing some mass exports with a doomscript but I found quartz to be a easier solution, with a bonus that it kind of looks like (which I'm sure it was originally meant for) a host-yourself variant of obsidian publish.

Most of these will be just random things I'm reading, I think. I still need to figure out a good way to do a slip-box. I have a org server extension I can send links to but I forget to do it. Same with pocket (non-open source reasons aside, the emacs package works well)
