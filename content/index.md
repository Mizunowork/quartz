- **Weekly Work Commitments:** Due by Mon 12pm MDT / Mon 9pm TRT / Tues 3am PHT. Simply send a note on Teams with the GitHub issue numbers you're working on. Include which issues you expect to submit a PR for during the week. This helps us gauge pacing and identify unclear issues before the weekly call. If an issue is listed without a PR expectation, it could be because 1. the issue is unclear (we can discuss), 2. the scope/complexity is unclear (we can discuss), or 3. the effort required exceeds your available time for the week.

- **Weekly Progress Call:** Tues 10-11am MDT / Tues 7-8pm TRT / Wed 12-1am PHT.

- **Mark "@" Mentions Availability (Teams / GitHub):** 1-2 hour response time from 12-5am PHT unless explained.

- **Weekly PRs (Reviewed):** Complete within 48 business hours (Mon-Fri) unless explained via "@" in GitHub.

- **Blackout Dates (Unavailable):** Communicate any planned unavailability (vacation, holidays, etc.) at least 2 weeks in advance.
