I built two mechanical keyboards in the past month. Here's what I learned.

## The Problem

I have two areas where I use keyboards. My home desk, and my work. 

At home, I had a "gaming keyboard", which was starting to become unbearable. It had generation 1 "silent" switches, which were both loud and uncomfortable to type on.

I did enjoy its ergonomics outside of the way the switches felt, but that wasn't enough to justify attempting to retrofit the nearly 10-year-old soldered keyboard.

And at work, I had a generic membrane keyboard that always felt off no matter how I positioned it. Obviously, a change was needed.

I do still like a quieter typing experience, as long as it feels alright to my fingers. So I decided to go with newer silent switches.
