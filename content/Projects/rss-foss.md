RSS is the best and most private way to subscribe to a website, social media account, or more. No site analytics, no page loading, no Javascript, no ads. All the website can see is that you pulled one plaintext file from it.
## Vision
RSS shouldn't just be a one-feed thing. Granularity is key.

More to come when I get time haha
