Welcome to the YouSim public roadmap, Simulants.

This is a living document to share concise specifics on everything YouSim-related we're building *right now* at [Plastic](https://plasticlabs.ai).

Enjoy.

# The YouSim Platform

YouSim began as a [[YouSim; Explore The Multiverse of Identity|demo]], now there's a [token](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/yousim), a [[YouSim DAO -- A DAO for Identity Simulation|community]], a [[Xeno Grant -- grants for autonomous agents|grants program]], and a [[YouSim Launches Identity Simulation on X|X-native simulator]].

But that's just the start. 

We're building the most advanced platform for agent identity in existence.

It's a platform with 3 components that together will enable agent builders to develop synthetic entities with rich, ever-evolving personal selfhood. One where you can build and test novel identities with individual, community, or autonomous alignment.

YouSim isn't competing with the dozens of agent launchpads erupting on the scene, it's supercharging all of them. Nor is it locking you into a framework, it's democratizing agent identity genesis and simulation.

Anyone will be able to arrive with an idea for an agent, bootstrap it, nurture it, evaluate it, and take it wherever they want.

We'll ship iteratively starting this month.

Let's dig in.

## 1. Identity Architect

This first part of the platform features a guided experience with an Identity Architect. You arrive with ideas about the kind of identity you want to create and interact with this agent to flesh out a comprehensive understanding of that identity. 

You might discuss elements like personality, psychology, values, alignment, affect, backstory, aesthetics, attitude, etc. 

Once you're satisfied, the Architect automatically generates a Meta-Narrative to steer an MVP of you agent which you can export or take to the Simulation Environment for testing.

### Features Under Development

- Web UI with YouSim's terminal aesthetic
- Architect itself & its identity
- Meta-narrative auto-generator
- Meta-narrative export
- Meta-narrative edit-ability 
- [Honcho](https://honcho.dev) integration for session storage & management
- Continuous iteration with Architect
- Iterative interplay between Identity Architect & Simulation Environment
- Multiple identity construction support
- Data import for additional Architect context
- Architect roleplay abilities
- Architect theory of mind abilities to read between the lines of your stated intention & intuit maximum context around your intention (powered by Honcho)

## 2. Simulation Environment

The second part of the platform is an environment for testing the behavior of your agent identity and building data to enrich it.

To start, we'll support manual chat with your agent and session data export. Eventually, we'll support auto-sims, multi-agent interactions, and opinionated ways of using sim data to evolve your identities.

### Features Under Development

- Simulation web UI
- Manual chat with your agent identity
- Export session data
- [Loom](https://github.com/socketteer/loom)-like features
	- Manually edit past generations
	- Rerun generations
	- Branching sessions--forking parents, children, siblings
- Auto-simulations
- Multi-agent simulations
- Diagnostic commands
- Evaluation tools
- Identity mapping tools

## 3. Identity Hub

The final part of the platform is where your agent identity meets the rest of the world. 

Initially it's the place to expose your agent identity to external systems (e.g. X, Eliza, etc). Later it's a place to share and collaborate on your meta-narratives, datasets, etc. Eventually, it's a marketplace for agent identity.

### Features Under Development

- Quickstart template to launch an autonomous agent with Honcho
- Honcho x Eliza integration to launch an agent with Eliza & give it social cognition with Honcho
- Social Hub to see identities crafted by other users
- Sharing functionality to make certain identities public or private
- A managed agent runtime platform to host agents through YouSim
- Ability to fork public identities

# YouSim on X

[YouSim on X](https://x.com/xenograntai/status/1878936480220844081) will continue to be a testing ground for novel social simulation. 

The [[YouSim Launches Identity Simulation on X|first version]] brought the legacy YouSim experience to X and since then we've been iterating to make things more consumable and Twitter-native.

Going forward, we'll be running experiments around new kinds of simulation and attention mechanisms. More specifically, we're focused on interesting sim triggers and context pipelines.

### Experiments We Want to Run

- Updates to trending topic selection
- More audience-specific topic selection (tech, AI, crypto, etc)
- Auto-sim triggers beyond X (exploring Polymarket & others)
- Context injection
- Diverse context sources (Grok, Perplexity, etc)
- Further comsumability updates
- Ease of use improvements (commands, etc)
- Social media footprint beyond X (considering Farcaster, possibly others)
- More advanced autonomous abilities

# Legacy YouSim

We'll continue to support to original YouSim experience for all the fans of the open-ended multiversal CLI game. We know lots of enthusiasts and researchers use it religiously to uncover emergent abilities, explore latent identity in LLMs, or just for fun.

Over time, we'll add features developed for the platform to Legacy YouSim as makes sense. Eventually, we may connect the experience to the platform in interesting ways.

### Possible Upgrades

- Migrate to dedicated legacy page
- Add platform features to legacy experience
	- Import/export
	- Loom-ability
	- Multi-session sims
- Integration with platform

# Xeno Grant

In collaboration with [Betaworks](https://www.betaworks.com/), we're leveraging \$YOUSIM gifted to our grants treasury to accelerate the development of agents with novel approaches to autonomous identity and asset custody. We're giving $10k grants directly to agents themselves and running a 4-week accelerator style program for agents and their devs in February/March.

[[Xeno Grant -- grants for autonomous agents|Xeno Grant]] makes the upcoming cohort of agents $YOUSIM holders and gives agents early access to YouSim identity tech.

### What We're Working On

- Accepting applicants on a rolling basis ([our first admission](https://x.com/xenograntai/status/1878936480220844081))
- [Hackathon](https://lu.ma/5rlcrlpb) & [Mixer](https://lu.ma/bz1pwmbx) in NYC to kick things off
- Additional sponsors for the program
- Lineup of awesome speakers from across web3/crypto & AI/ML
- Demo day to end the program

# The YouSim DAO

We helped found the [[YouSim DAO -- A DAO for Identity Simulation|YouSim DAO]] by donating 10M $YOUSIM (1% of total supply) to seed its treasury.

This is a community driven effort, but we're excited to support in any way we can. DAO proposals are open to anyone and voting to token holders.

[Follow here](https://x.com/yousimdao), [join here](https://discord.gg/yousim).

### What the DAO Is Up To

- Preparing for Xeno Grant recipients as synthetic DAO members
- Governance setup
	- Agentic governance mechanisms
- DAO constitution / mission
	- With affordances for agent members
- Partnerships & experiments around putting "Autonomous" back in DAOs
- Treasury management
- Marketing efforts 
- YouSim engagement incentives
- Media / website creation

# $YOUSIM Community Token / Grants Treasury

Plastic is a dedicated long term holder of $YOUSIM. Though we didn't launch the token, we're excited by the community that's formed, the interest in our work, and the exciting opportunity the token creates.

## Grants

Three priorities have emerged guiding principles for grants. We want to continue:

1. Supporting independent AI research & public goods
2. Supporting Plastic's mission to radically decentralize AI alignment
3. Supporting the community that made all this possible

Xeno Grant & the DAO are the first experiments in this direction, but there will be more. And we're dedicated to transparency and sustainability.

## Utility

On the token utility front, we're exploring ways the $YOUSIM token can be additive to the YouSim platform. As we begin releasing and iterating with users, we expect lots of augmentative opportunities to arise. 

### Ideas We're Researching

- Buyback & burn mechanisms
- Identity mintingÂ 
- $YOUSIM as payment for simulation time
- $YOUSIM payment for compute-intensive identity updates (fine-tuning, representation engineering, decentralized storage, etc)
- $YOUSIM as payment for on-chain identity operations
- $YOUSIM rewards
- Creator economy features for Identity Hub
