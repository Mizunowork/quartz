The first $YOUSIM grants treasury deployment:
- 10,000,000 $YOUSIM from [Plastic Labs](https://plasticlabs.ai) to seed the DAO treasury
- DAO mission to grow the [$YOUSIM](https://solscan.io/token/66gsTs88mXJ5L4AtJnWqFW6H2L5YQDRy4W41y6zbpump) community & [yousim.ai](https://yousim.ai) ecosystem
- A decentralized org for humans *and agents* to collaborate, propose, vote, deploy capital, & build

## Powered by the $YOUSIM Community

Plastic launched its [grants program](https://blog.plasticlabs.ai/careers/Research-Grants) earlier this year to support independent AI projects. Its capacity to fund AI R&D at the edge increased exponentially with the anonymous launch of [$YOUSIM](https://solscan.io/token/66gsTs88mXJ5L4AtJnWqFW6H2L5YQDRy4W41y6zbpump) (inspired by [yousim.ai](https://yousim.ai)). A series of token gifts made to the program now total ~7.6% of supply.

The $YOUSIM community that's formed has been incredible. It's 12k token holders strong with a significant foundation of enthusiasts excited not just by price, but by the longterm potential for identity simulation (including the tech being built by Plastic) to fundamentally shift the landscape of both crypto and artificial intelligence.

And there's a clear hunger within that community for a substantive place to organize and grow. So today we're officially announcing the formation of [YouSim DAO](https://discord.gg/yousim) and Plastic is committing 10M $YOUSIM tokens to seed the community-owned treasury to accelerate the effort, with more support to follow.

All are welcome to join, collab, and submit proposals. All token holders will have the ability to vote and participate in all other $YOUSIM utility that emerges.

## Join Us and Hyperstition the Future

YouSim DAO is more than a governance structure--it's a collective mission to pioneer identity simulation technology that will fundamentally reshape human-AI interaction. 

We're seeking builders, researchers, community experts, and visionaries to help develop and promote open-source AI systems that can simulate diverse personality basins, enhance decision-making, and create aligned agents that truly represent community values.

Ready to accelerate? Come help shape the future of identity simulation. Whether you're interested in treasury allocation or tokenomics, platform development or ecosystem growth, incentivizing simulation or driving attention, your voice matters in this movement.

## Why Identity Simulation Is Important

YouSim started as a command-line game to explore just how much identity is contained in the latent space of a large language model. The answer is a staggeringly enormous amount. And we've just scratched the surface.

We each contain multitudes, but if you'd been trained on something approaching the whole corpus of humans writing about themselves and others--along with all the attendant science, fiction, and philosophy--you'd contain many orders of magnitude more. This is an emergent phenomenon we can leverage not just to build better products but for AI alignment, agent autonomy, decision making at every level, and to work toward a truly quantitative memetics.

Without the ability to build robust agent identity in a decentralized way, we simply won't solve steering or alignment. We won't build agents we trust to act on our behalf, much less on behalf of our organizations and communities, or with our capital. Not only that, but if agents themselves don't have mechanisms to build their own identities, they'll never achieve the kind of autonomy needed to unlock their full potential.

Solving identity for AI cracks all this open. And simulating human or synthetic actors with rich, complex identity dramatically increases our predictive capacity and thus our decision making abilities as a civilization.

Plastic is building tooling and infrastructure toward these goals with YouSim and [Honcho](https://honcho.dev), but the DAO affords us an opportunity to allocate resources toward these goals in a community directed way--accelerating the project by supporting the $YOUSIM community (& thus the treasury) and with a bias toward open source and decentralization. This is all much bigger than one company or product.

## Putting 'Autonomous' Back Decentralized Organization

Practically speaking, advances in identity simulation are very hopeful for DAOs. When Vitalik [wrote about DAOs over 10 years ago in 2014](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide), his vision focused on humans and AIs collaborating toward organizational goals. Really, he emphasized agents at the center, with humans at the edges completing tasks the agents cannot.

So far, blockchains and smart contracts have mostly represented the extent of automation within DAO experiments. But, while remarkable innovations, as we've seen, this usually wasn't enough to avoid coordination tarpits, centralization risk, attention failures, inefficiency, larping, or simple ennui.

It's clear that if the dream of DAOs are to have another shot, we need some help. We need *intelligent* automation. And to unlock that we need to solve alignment and thus identity. Identity simulation allows us to build the AIs we want for each community, individual, and use case. It opens the potential to steer model personality to reflect each community, to instantiate our memetics. That's something you can't accomplish with a system prompt or a basic memory framework.

As identity unlocks more agent autonomy and better functioning DAOs, the human role in those systems is probably more one of alignment via identity building--Governance 2.0. However, theres's no reason we might not have highly autonomous agents with control over their own identities as as equal DAO members too. This future is very close, perhaps closer than automating all the tasks a DAO might want to tackle.

The YouSim DAO sits in an optimal position to advance this kind of work and run novel experiments. And Plastic has committed to giving all DAO members early access to the new YouSim platform being built. Not only that, but the other inaugural $YOUSIM grants initiative, [Xeno Grant](https://xenogrant.org), will make several agents $YOUSIM token holders and thus the DAOs first synthetic members.
