With my recent commitment to the Blueprint stack of 400 euros a month, I calculated my full nutrition and supplementation costs this morning. 

Buying almost everything at Albert Heijn and everything Bio/Organic, super veggie + dinner is about 10 euros a day. I buy organic black lentils in bulk at de Notenkoerier.

The Blueprint stack includes one meal, so these two meals suffice as costs.

To be sure I’m calculating 12 euros a day for food, because I’ll add nuts and fruits and other variables. 

So my total costs for living the blueprint lifestyle while shopping organically at Albert Heijn will be 12 * 31 + 400 = 772 euros a month. 

This only includes the Blueprint stack in terms of supplementation and might need some further supplements later. But considering I’m only taking multivitamins currently, it is a great improvement already.
