# Entrepreneurship is making my mind race and less calm

This is not unexpected, and it is an excellent way to practice. Like Ajahn Chah always did, he would always go against the grain. Ajahn Chah never stayed comfortable. He was always seeking ways to challenge himself and to see how his mind would react.

My challenge now is to recover my inner calm as this journey of entrepreneurship ensues and as I start to live a life with more instability.
