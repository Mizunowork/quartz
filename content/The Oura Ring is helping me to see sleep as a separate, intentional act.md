The Latency metric, or the time it takes to fall asleep, is proving to be very insightful to me. I did not know I was taking so much time to fall asleep (45 minutes, 32 minutes). Oura recommends falling asleep in around 15-20 minutes, so I definitely have some work to do here.

This is exactly why I purchased my Oura ring. You cannot base everything on feeling. I feel great most of the time! Even when I was still sleeping 5 hours a night and drinking alcohol every day, 8 years ago, I felt amazing. But feeling amazing does not equate good health. 

It's good health that will lead to sustainable well being, and I wish to achieve this by tracking my sleep and other metrics, and already the ring is helping me to become much more intentional about sleep.
