When implementing an `if` statement that includes a single-statement code block, Microsoft recommends that you consider these conventions:

- Never use single-line form (for example: if (flag) Console.WriteLine(flag);
- Using braces is always accepted, and required if any block of an if/else if/.../else compound statement uses braces or if a single statement body spans multiple lines.
- Braces may be omitted only if the body of every block associated with an if/else if/.../else compound statement is placed on a single line.
