[I Saw the TV Glow - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Saw_the_TV_Glow) - 2024 film, I wandered into this because of Rotten Tomatoes,
I think. I liked it, the audience score is higher than I thought given
the themes (suburbia, conformity, identity). I could see someone being
disappointed if they came into it purely as a 'horror' fan.


## Watching Notes {#watching-notes}

-   A24! I feel like I see them everywhere now.
-   Are you afraid of the dark analogue? Campfire scene thingymajig
-   I'm curious if we're going to get more 90's nostalgia like we did with the
    80's
-   Unsure what the pink opaque itself could be a reference to
    -   monster of the week? (was mentioned after - yeah)
    -   musical choice and framing reminds me of twin peaks
-   identity discussion, not feeling anything, asexuality?
    -   (after watching) oh.
-   the time skips aren't as distracting as I was worried about
-   okay, so the uh..  "i need to leave" was literal
-   the overlays feel a bit off, I'm not sure if that was intended?
-   if this was a real show, and I watched it as a kid, I probably would've been traumatized
-   I think I get what it's going for, but uh..
-   I caught a glimpse of the reviews mentioning the trans identity issues - as of
    writing this I didn't expect it to be that object-level? I am curious where it's
    going to go with it
-   soup party
-   so, uh, it was literal, huh
-   okay, working that job is more dread inducing than
