I am always very mindful of my energy and not to wear myself out. But I also noticed that when I'm taking it easy, meditating a lot and focussing on not being active all the time, I also need less sleep and my sleep score goes down.

I think the Oura ring is helping me to find a proper balance between rest and activity through the readiness and sleep scores. Maybe I can handle more than I thought, but because I had bad sleep and didn't make sleep my #1 priority, I was unable to recover from the activity that I was doing (social activities, exercise, work and study) and therefore I started feeling the need for rest.
