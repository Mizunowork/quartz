Luhmann used Maps of Content! They are referred to as indexes in the book. The MoC's were entry points to strings of notes (thought).

The index of the Zettelkasten is very insightful in how he created structure and divided things up in subtopics.

The picture you see is from the digital version of Luhmann's Zettelkasten. What you see here is part of the Index that Luhman actually used. This is a list of the entry notes which I was just talking about.

When he needed to look up a certain topic, he would use his index to find the entry point to his chain of thoughts, and then navigate further from there.
