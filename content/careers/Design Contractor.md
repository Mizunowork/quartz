(Remote, Contract)

## About the Role
We're searching for a design contractor to update our digital franchises. This includes but isn't limited to our websites ([here](https://plasticlabs.ai), [here](https://honcho.dev), & [here](https://blog.plasticlabs.ai)) and assets for social sites.

A good fit is someone who is full-stack; has a clearly defined process; is willing to work with existing brand kit primitives; has proven ability to cohere quickly to team aesthetic, product, and mission; and can deliver fresh, subversive ideas rapidly.

If you've explored Plastic Labs and are excited by what we're up to, let's chat.

## About You
- 2-5 years experience professional full time designer
- Full-stack development ability
- Ability to design & build end-to-end
- Ability to grok product, mission, & aesthetics quickly
- Refined organized process for aligning to company needs
- Capacity to scope work & execute in predetermined timeframe
- Robust portfolio of recent work
- Recent customer references
- High empathy & agency

## How to Apply
Please send the following to ops@plasticlabs.ai:
- **Resume/CV** in whatever form it exists (PDF, LinkedIn, website, etc)
- **Portfolio** of notable & relevant work (links, docs, etc)
- **Statement** of process--how do you work, why is this a fit, how can you help?
- **References** you've worked with recently (2-3)

Applications without these 4 items won't be considered, but be sure to optimize for speed over perfection.

And it can't hurt to [join Discord](https://discord.gg/plasticlabs) or DM us [on X](https://x.com/plastic_labs) and introduce yourself.
