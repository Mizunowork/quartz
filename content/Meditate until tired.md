# Meditate until tired

I'm going through a phase of insomnia. I will get tired at 20:00 like normal, go to bed, and after 1 hour I have to get up because I can't sleep.

From now, when the day ends at 20:30, I will just do sitting meditation until I start nodding off. Time spent meditating is never wasted.

Meditation has fallen to the background in the past few months and I'm noticing it. Need to meditate more, and this is a good way of getting in some hours again, especially in these times of insomnia..Time spent meditating is never wasted.
