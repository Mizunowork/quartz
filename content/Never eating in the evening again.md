It is just so much easier to limit myself this way. I'm hungry an hour after lunch anyway. So I might as well be hungry all evening too. Really, the one meal in the evening really doesn't make any difference. Having a snack at 17 or 18 never really satisfies me and I'm hungry at bedtime anyway.

However, the risks that come with the afternoon snack far outweigh the discomfort of hunger. Without exception I always eat more than I really wanted to eat. Needing to do grocery shopping after the main meal is a major risk too. [[Always do the grocery shopping before consuming the main meal.]]
