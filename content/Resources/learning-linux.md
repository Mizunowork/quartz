**Check most popular videos on these channels for the most informative content.**

-  [DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DistroTube/videos): Covers a variety of small topics within linux, as well as lots of top-10 style content for distros and programs.
-  [The Linux Experiment](https://www.youtube.com/@TheLinuxEXP/videos): Great weekly news source on the state of Linux and open source projects. Also publishes comparison videos for sets of programs, and the occasional distro tier list.
- [Chris Titus Tech](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisTitusTech/): Goes pretty in-depth on specific programs (web browsers, code editors, etc) and makes the occasional tutorial. Also tier lists, but his opinions on tier lists are not really suited to new users.
- [Brodie Robertson](https://www.youtube.com/@BrodieRobertson): Reviewer on the bleeding edge. Don't take his advice if you want a daily driver, but he keeps on top of everything major in the Linux community.
