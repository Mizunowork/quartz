## The Situation
Microsoft's release of Recall on Windows is a security **nightmare**. It's easily accessed by hackers, it promotes domestic abuse, and it spells the full forced\* integration of data-Hoovering AI "features" into the home and enterprise  computing.
- \*: Enterprise has a hidden policy setting to disable it, for now. Additionally, you *can* disable some AI features on home computers, but Windows has a history of re-enabling disabled features on update, and you can't disable automatic updates without breaking other features like Visual Studio and the Microsoft Store.


Microsoft has left many in search of an alternative operating system that doesn't intrude on their privacy by default. That alternative is **Linux**. 

Traditionally, the Linux community is known for being hostile to newcomers. But in response to this event, I've seen a lot of people commit to being much more open with their knowledge. I'd love to also share my knowledge on the subject.

## Scope
I've been daily driving Linux for a combined total of 1.5 years, chronicled [[Essays/on-linux|here]]. I want this entry to serve as a starting point that explains Linux from zero, but I'll try to avoid reinventing the wheel. Many people have written or produced content on . It'll be updated over time. If anything is confusing or if I miss an important topic, please let me know! A [[Misc/what-is-a-garden|digital garden]] is an iterative process.
## Basic knowledge
Linux is designed for someone already familiar with one variant to be able to make certain assumptions about any other Linux system. This is more of a guideline to modern design choices than an actual rule. It's in place because Linux grew out of a collection of operating system standards called POSIX. Most of those standards pertain to how the system behaves when you interact with it through a **terminal**.

### Youtubers
**Check most popular videos on these channels for the most informative content.**

-  [DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DistroTube/videos): Covers a variety of small topics within linux, as well as lots of top-10 style content for distros and programs.
-  [The Linux Experiment](https://www.youtube.com/@TheLinuxEXP/videos): Great weekly news source on the state of Linux and open source projects. Also publishes comparison videos for sets of programs, and the occasional distro tier list.
- [Chris Titus Tech](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisTitusTech/): Goes pretty in-depth on specific programs (web browsers, code editors, etc) and makes the occasional tutorial. Also tier lists, but his opinions on tier lists are not really suited to new users.
- [Brodie Robertson](https://www.youtube.com/@BrodieRobertson): Reviewer on the bleeding edge. Don't take his advice if you want a daily driver (and ensure to actually explore the controversies that he makes you aware of), but he keeps on top of everything major in the Linux community.
