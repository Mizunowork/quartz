This is the first day of eating all my food before 13. I've been quite hungry sometimes during the afternoon but it has gone surprisingly well. I've simply made the decision that this is the protocol and that my feelings are irrelevant.

I can dismiss the hunger as an annoying sensation in the body which I just need to accept as part of my experience. It is what is necessary to lose weight and live healthily. I have at least 5 kilos to lose so this feeling is going to stay.

And even when I have lost that weight, I will still continue this protocol. It's what Bryan still does. 

Not eating in the afternoon brings me back to my years in the monastery. We always ate at 11am and could only consume honey and liquids or dark chocolate in the afternoon. It's such a healthy routine, and it's astounding that it was established by the Buddha for his monastic community so long ago.
