This article is somewhat of a glossary for all the words/phrases that I use that originate with Linux or related projects like GNU.

## On Acronyms
Unix LOVES their acronyms. `ls`? LiSt. `cat`? conCATenate. `grep`?  Globular Regular Expression Print. Many commands and programs were designed to be typed quickly in the early days of computing, and holdovers persist to this day.
## Definitions
### BSD
- [Berkeley Software Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution).
	1. A now-defunct free operating system regarded as the predecessor to modern Linux.
	2. A free software license. Most commonly in modern use, the BSD 2-Clause License, aka the FreeBSD license.
### Symlink
- Short for "Symbolic Link." 
- A file in a Linux system is really just a pointer to a location on a storage device. 
- A symlink is just a pointer to a pointer [repeat N times] to a location on a storage device.
