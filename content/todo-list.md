Here’s what I’m working on right now. Some of it might not make sense, I use this personally to keep track of what I’m writing. 

Bolded entries are being actively written, and may either be published with or note edits in the next update post. Italicized entries have been started, but placed on the back burner.

The date on this page will not be accurate in order to avoid spamming RSS feeds.
