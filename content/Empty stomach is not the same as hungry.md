Sadhguru says this. They are two separate things.

An empty stomach can be a good thing. True hunger indicates lack of food and nutrients.

But now that I'm on the [[Blueprint 5am daily routine]], I feel an empty stomach in the evening but no hunger. I can feel I have eaten enough today to get me through the night and to breakfast tomorrow.
